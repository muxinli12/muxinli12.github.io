Hi! I’m **Muxin Li**, a graduate student in **Biostatistics — Public Health Data Science** at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. I recently completed my Bachelor’s degree in **Economics** and **Mathematics** at the University of California, Davis.

I’m passionate about applying **statistics and data visualization** to answer complex questions in **public health, healthcare analytics, and quantitative finance**. 

This website serves as a growing portfolio of my academic projects, analytical work, and professional development throughout my graduate studies.
